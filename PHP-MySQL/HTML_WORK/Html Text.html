	<p class="p1">Sanjana was two years our senior and in the first year of post graduation. To me she
					was the epitome of a ‘perfect woman’. She looked gorgeous with perfectly chiselled
					aquiline features, light eyes that sparkled, a clear complexion, a fashionable haircut and a
					wonderful diction to match. She was tall, wore trendy clothes, spoke well and oozed
					confidence. She had even modelled for a few print advertisements and was the cover girl in
					a regional magazine.</p>
